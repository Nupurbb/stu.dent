# Choose Your Adventure Game

You find yourself standing at a crossroads in a mystical forest. You have two paths to choose from:

1. [Go left into the dark forest](#left-path)
2. [Go right towards the enchanted castle](#right-path)

## Left Path

As you venture deeper into the dark forest, you encounter a talking owl. It offers you a riddle:

*What has keys but can't open locks?*

1. [A piano](#piano)
2. [A treasure chest](#treasure-chest)

### Piano

The owl congratulates you for solving the riddle and shows you the way out of the forest.

## Treasure Chest

You open the treasure chest but trigger a trap! Game over.

## Right Path

You approach the enchanted castle, and a guardian challenges you:

*To enter, you must guess my favorite number between 1 and 10.*

Guess a number between 1 and 10:

1. [1](#wrong-guess)
2. [5](#correct-guess)
3. [9](#wrong-guess)

### Correct Guess

The guardian is impressed by your guess, and you are allowed to enter the castle. You've won!

### Wrong Guess

The guardian does not let you enter the castle, and you must turn back.
